# udacity-react-fundamentals-myReads

MyReads web app is created using ReactJS as a part of the Udacity React Nanodegree program.

## About
This project was initially created based on a starter template providing CSS and basic HTML structure from Udacity. A backend API was also provided to communicate with a Backend Server from Udacity for book information and long term storage.

MyReads lets you manage your digital bookshelf. Supports three shelves:
- Currently Reading
- Want to Read
- Read
Additionally you can search and add books to any shelf. 

This app is the first of three projects required for [Udacity's React Nanodegree program](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019).
